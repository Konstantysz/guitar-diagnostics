Before committing, verify:

1. All methods implemented in .cpp (not in headers)
2. Constructor initializer lists used (no in-class init)
3. No `using namespace` (except test files)
4. Pointer alignment: `Type *var` (right-aligned)
5. PascalCase namespaces (e.g., GuitarDiagnostics::Analysis)
6. Tests pass (mention this, don't run)
7. Single-line commit message prepared (imperative mood)

Suggest commit message if changes clear.
